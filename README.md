Clone the GitHub repository: navigate to a directory where you want to store the Flask application on your computer. In the command prompt or terminal, you can clone the repository using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the URL of the GitHub repository you shared with them.

Set up a virtual environment (optional): It's good practice to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. In the command prompt or terminal, your friend can navigate to the project directory and create a new virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
cd TacomaScuba  # Change to the project directory
python -m venv env  # Create a new virtual environment
Activate the virtual environment (optional): Your friend should activate the virtual environment using the appropriate command for their operating system:

For Windows:

bash
Copy code
.\env\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy code
source env/bin/activate
Install project dependencies: In the activated virtual environment, your friend can install the project dependencies (Flask) using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure the requirements.txt file is present in the project directory. If not, create a file named requirements.txt and add the following line to it:

Copy code
Flask
Run the Flask application: Your friend can start the Flask application by running the following command in the command prompt or terminal:

bash
Copy code
flask run
The application will start, and your friend can access it in their web browser by navigating to the provided server address (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

With these instructions, your friend should be able to clone the repository, set up the necessary dependencies, and run the Flask application on their computer.
